# Create a new repository from template

Go to the [template](https://github.com/ninetailsrabbit/indie-blueprint) and create a new repository from it

![use_template](images/use_template.png)

---

# Configuration

This template starts with some initial configurations that you need to know to get the most out of it.

## Default bus layout

There is a default bus layout to use in your project that are sufficient for any small-medium indie game, you can extend it or modify based on your use case but here's a good place to start

![bus_layout](images/bus_layout.png)

- `Master`: The master bus where all the other inherit froms
- `Music`: Mainly used to play looping music in your game
- `SFX/EchoSFX`: Sound effects like gun shots, hits, footsteps and so on. When you want to add an echo effect to the effect use the “EchoSFX” bus.
- `Voice`: Dialogues, ai voice effects, breath.
- `UI`: User interface sounds, button clicks, hover, transition animations, etc.
- `Ambient`: Ambient sounds like wind, nature, ocean, house interior and other stuff

## Input map

This project comes with very simple predefined input maps to avoid interfering with your game in a tedious way

- `WASD` movement with the keys `move_forward`, `move_back`, `move_right`, `move_left`
- `WASD` keys as been added to the existing ui input maps `ui_up`, `ui_down`, `ui_right`, `ui_left`
- The input action `debug_metrics` **_Shift+P_** opens the performance metrics when `hardware_information.tscn` it's on the scene tree

## Physics layers 2D & 3D

- `Layer 1`: It's named **World**
- `Layer 2`: It's named **Player**
- `Layer 3`: It's named **Enemies**
- `Layer 4`: It's named **Hitboxes**, `hitboxes` are collision areas that `hurtboxes` detects to implement a damage or impact system.

# Autoloads

A bunch of autoloads are ready to use for common operation in videogames to manage audio, global variables, signals, gamepad support, persistence, etc.

## GameGlobals & GlobalGameEvents

This singletons works to share data across nodes, they are always on the scene tree and can be accesed anywhere.

`GameGlobals` contains the pre-configured physic layer values and is intended to implement here the variables or functions that need to be accessed globally in your game.

```swift
extends Node


#region Physics layers
const world_collision_layer: int = 1
const player_collision_layer: int = 2
const enemies_collision_layer: int = 4
const hitboxes_collision_layer: int = 8
#endregion


```

`GlobalGameEvents` contains all the global signals by which any node or script can connect. It contains few basic ones and this is where you should place those events that you want multiple nodes to listen to

## WindowManager

One of the most important and allows you to have control of the game windows as well as resolution information, take screenshots and much more.

**By default**, it's connected to the `size_changed` signal of the `root` node to center the monitor screen automatically when a resolution it's changed.

### Resolutions

There is multiple constants defined in this manager to get the resolutions from a specific aspect-ratio, this are:

```swift
// Use the built-in methods to get resolutions, this methods support a boolean variable to limit the resolutions based on the player current monitor
WindowManager.get_mobile_resolutions()
WindowManager.get_4_3_resolutions()
WindowManager.get_16_9_resolutions()
WindowManager.get_16_10_resolutions()
WindowManager.get_21_9_resolutions()

// List of available resolutions
var resolutions: Dictionary = {
	Resolution_Mobile: [
		Vector2i(320, 480),  # Older smartphones
		Vector2i(320, 640),
		Vector2i(375, 667),  # Older smartphones

		Vector2i(5120, 2880),
		Vector2i(7680, 4320), # 8K
	]
}

```

### Screen methods

`center_window_position(viewport: Viewport = get_viewport()) -> void`

Center the window position based on the monitor screen _(not the viewport)_. This is called automatically when the `size_changed` signal is emitted so there is no reason to use it individually.

`screen_center() -> Vector2i`

Get the center of the viewport screen in the world

`monitor_screen_center() -> Vector2i:`

Center of the current PC screen monitor

`get_camera2d_frame(viewport: Viewport = get_viewport()) -> Rect2`

Get the frame rect where the current active `Camera2D` is on the screen, useful to see which elements are inside the camera and can be visible.

### Screenshot

`screenshot(viewport: Viewport) -> Image`

Take a screenshot of the current viewport and return it as an [Image](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_image.html) class

`screenshot_to_texture_rect(viewport: Viewport, texture_rect: TextureRect = TextureRect.new()) -> TextureRect`

Take a screenshot of the current viewport and insert it as a texture into a [TextureRect](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_texturerect.html) node

### Parallax

These methods automatically adapt the appropriate parallax size according to the current screen resolution. It supports the old [ParallaxBackground](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_parallaxbackground.html) and the new [Parallax2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_parallax2d.html)

`adapt_parallax_background_to_horizontal_viewport(parallax_background: ParallaxBackground, viewport: Rect2 = get_window().get_visible_rect()) -> void`

`adapt_parallax_background_to_vertical_viewport(parallax_background: ParallaxBackground, viewport: Rect2 = get_window().get_visible_rect()) -> void`

`adapt_parallax_to_horizontal_viewport(parallax: Parallax2D, viewport: Rect2 = get_window().get_visible_rect()) -> void`

`adapt_parallax_to_vertical_viewport(parallax: Parallax2D, viewport: Rect2 = get_window().get_visible_rect()) -> void`

# Utilities

General utilities that does not belongs to a particular place and are sed as static classes that can be accessed at any time even if they are not in the scene tree.

## File handling

The `FileHelper` class provides static methods to work with file extensions mainly parsing or retrieving metadata.

---

`filepath_is_valid(path: String) -> bool`

Validate a file path to know if the file is in good condition and is accessible to operate with it.

`dirpath_is_valid(path: String) -> bool`

Validate a directory path to know if the file is in good condition and is accessible to operate with it.

`directory_exist_on_executable_path(directory_path: String) -> bool`

Validate a directory path where the godot executable folder is.

`get_files_recursive(path: String, regex: RegEx = null) -> Array`

Get all the files recursively on the path provided, a `RegEx` can be passed to filter the files to retrieve.

`copy_directory_recursive(from_dir :String, to_dir :String) -> Error`

Copy content of a folder recursively into another overwrite existing files on the process.

`remove_files_recursive(path: String, regex: RegEx = null) -> Error`

Remove all the files recursively on the path provided, a `RegEx` can be passed to filter what files to delete.

`static func get_pck_files(path: String) -> Array`

This is actually a shortcut to retrieve all the `.pck` files on a folder but uses `get_files_recursive` with a `RegEx` behind the scenes.

`load_csv(path: String, as_dictionary: bool = true): Variant`

This function loads a CSV/TSV file from the specified path and returns the parsed data, when `as_dictionary` is false the first array will be the columns. Although the function name only includes `.csv` it also supports `.tsv` files that separate by tabs instead of commas

- **path (String):** The absolute path to the CSV/TSV file.
- **as_dictionary (bool, optional):** Defaults to true. When set to true, the function attempts to convert the parsed data into an array of dictionaries, using the first line of the CSV as column headers. If false, the function returns an array of arrays, where each inner array represents a row of data where the first row are the column headers.

**Returns:**

- **Variant:** The parsed CSV data can be either an array of dictionaries _(if as_dictionary is true)_ or an array of arrays.
- **ERR_PARSE_ERROR (int):** This error code is returned if there are issues opening the file, parsing the CSV data, or encountering data inconsistencies.

### How to use load_csv

For this example was used the `currency.csv` that you can find in [this website](https://wsform.com/knowledgebase/sample-csv-files/)

```bash
for line in FileHelper.load_csv("res://currency.csv", false):
		print_rich("ARRAY LINE ", line)

## Output of
[
	ARRAY LINE ["Code", "Symbol", "Name"] # Headers
	ARRAY LINE ["AED", "د.إ", "United Arab Emirates d"]
	ARRAY LINE ["AFN", "؋", "Afghan afghani"]
	ARRAY LINE ["ALL", "L", "Albanian lek"]
	ARRAY LINE ["AMD", "AMD", "Armenian dram"]
	ARRAY LINE ["ANG", "ƒ", "Netherlands Antillean gu"]
	ARRAY LINE ["AOA", "Kz", "Angolan kwanza"]
	ARRAY LINE ["ARS", "$", "Argentine peso"]
	ARRAY LINE ["AUD", "$", "Australian dollar"]
	ARRAY LINE ["AWG", "Afl.", "Aruban florin"]
	ARRAY LINE ["AZN", "AZN", "Azerbaijani manat"]
	ARRAY LINE ["BAM", "KM", "Bosnia and Herzegovina "]
	## ....
]

for line in FileHelper.load_csv("res://currency.csv"):
	print_rich("DICT LINE ", line)

## Output of
[
	DICT LINE { "Code": "AED", "Symbol": "د.إ", "Name": "United Arab Emirates d" }
	DICT LINE { "Code": "AFN", "Symbol": "؋", "Name": "Afghan afghani" }
	DICT LINE { "Code": "ALL", "Symbol": "L", "Name": "Albanian lek" }
	DICT LINE { "Code": "AMD", "Symbol": "AMD", "Name": "Armenian dram" }
	DICT LINE { "Code": "ANG", "Symbol": "ƒ", "Name": "Netherlands Antillean gu" }
	DICT LINE { "Code": "AOA", "Symbol": "Kz", "Name": "Angolan kwanza" }
	DICT LINE { "Code": "ARS", "Symbol": "$", "Name": "Argentine peso" }
	DICT LINE { "Code": "AUD", "Symbol": "$", "Name": "Australian dollar" }
	DICT LINE { "Code": "AWG", "Symbol": "Afl.", "Name": "Aruban florin" }
	DICT LINE { "Code": "AZN", "Symbol": "AZN", "Name": "Azerbaijani manat" }
	DICT LINE { "Code": "BAM", "Symbol": "KM", "Name": "Bosnia and Herzegovina " }
]
```

## Geometry

Functions to obtain information on sizes, measurements or to draw specific shapes

---

`get_random_mesh_surface_position(target: MeshInstance3D) -> Vector3`

Get a random position as `Vector3` on any mesh shape surface

`random_inside_unit_circle(position: Vector2, radius: float = 1.0) -> Vector2`

Get a random position as `Vector2` from the inside of a circle with the given `radius`

`random_on_unit_circle(position: Vector2) -> Vector2`

Get a random position as `Vector2` from a circunference

`random_point_in_rect(rect: Rect2) -> Vector2`

`random_point_in_annulus(center, radius_small, radius_large) -> Vector2`

Get a random point as `Vector2` in annulus _(a donut shape)_ with provided `center` and `radius provided`

`polygon_bounding_box(polygon: PackedVector2Array) -> Rect2`

Get the bounding box as `Rect2` from the polygon points provided

## Hardware detector

All the hardware information that we can obtain lives on this class, contains auto-detection of the video adapter to decide which would be the most suitable quality preset for the player as well as other functionalities.

The `QualityPreset` is just an enum that can be used as information

```swift
enum QualityPreset {
	Low,
	Medium,
	High,
	Ultra
}

```

When the game it's ready, a few variables are initialized to access this information quickly

```swift

static var engine_version: String = "Godot %s" % Engine.get_version_info().string
static var device: String = OS.get_model_name()
static var platform: String = OS.get_name()
static var distribution_name: String = OS.get_distribution_name()
static var video_adapter_name: String = RenderingServer.get_video_adapter_name()
static var processor_name: String = OS.get_processor_name()
static var processor_count: int = OS.get_processor_count()
static var usable_threads: int = processor_count * 2 # I assume that each core has 2 threads
static var computer_screen_size: Vector2i = DisplayServer.screen_get_size()

```

### Device/OS detection

Useful methods to detect the device on which the game is running and the operating system

---

`is_steam_deck() -> bool`

`is_mobile() -> bool`

`is_windows() -> bool`

`is_linux() -> bool`

`is_mac() -> bool`

`is_web() -> bool`

### Exports

Information related to the game build

`is_multithreading_enabled() -> bool`

`is_exported_release() -> bool`

### Auto-Discover quality preset

With this method you can obtain an accurate quality preset recommended based on the video-adapter player it's using

`auto_discover_graphics_quality() -> QualityPreset`

Based on the `QualityPreset` you can access a bunch of settings that can be changed from the dictionary `graphics_quality_presets` based on the [https://github.com/Calinou/godot-sponza/blob/master/scripts/settings_gui.gd](https://github.com/Calinou/godot-sponza/blob/master/scripts/settings_gui.gd) example:

```swift
static var graphics_quality_presets: Dictionary = {
	QualityPreset.Low: GraphicQualityPreset.new("For low-end PCs with integrated graphics, as well as mobile devices",
		[
			GraphicQualityDisplay.new("environment/glow_enabled","Glow", 0, "Disabled"),
			//...
		]

// Information classes structure  returned as settings configuration on the dictionary
class GraphicQualityPreset:
	var description: String = ""
	var quality: Array[GraphicQualityDisplay]

	func _init(_description:String, _quality: Array[GraphicQualityDisplay] = []) -> void:
		description = _description
		quality = _quality


class GraphicQualityDisplay:
	var project_setting: String = ""
	var property_name: String = ""
	var enabled: int = 0
	var available_text: String = ""

	func _init(_project_setting:  String, _property_name: String, _enabled: int, _available_text: String) -> void:
		project_setting = _project_setting
		property_name = _property_name
		enabled = _enabled
		available_text = _available_text
```

## Input

### InputHelper

This section introduces the `InputHelper`, a collection of helpful functions for handling common input-related tasks in your game. It acts as a shortcut to avoid repetitive code for frequently used input checks.

`is_mouse_visible() -> bool`

Return if the current mouse input mode is visible

`is_mouse_captured() -> bool`

Return if the current mouse input mode is captured

`show_mouse_cursor() -> void`

Change the current mouse mode to show the cursor

`show_mouse_cursor_confined() -> void`

Change the current mouse mode to confined

`capture_mouse() -> void`

Change the current mouse mode to captured

`hide_mouse_cursor() -> void`

Change the current mouse mode to hide

`hide_mouse_cursor_confined() -> void`

Change the current mouse mode to hide confined

` is_mouse_button(event: InputEvent) -> bool`

Quickly checks if the event is a mouse button

`is_mouse_left_click(event: InputEvent) -> bool`

Quickly checks if the left mouse button was clicked in the given InputEvent.

`is_mouse_right_click(event: InputEvent) -> bool`

Similar to **is_mouse_left_click**, but checks for the right mouse button click.

`is_mouse_left_button_pressed(event: InputEvent) -> bool`

Quickly check if the left mouse button is keep pressed

`is_mouse_right_button_pressed(event: InputEvent) -> bool`

Quickly check if the right mouse button is keep pressed

`numeric_key_pressed(event: InputEvent) -> bool`

Determines if a numeric key _(including numpad keys)_ was pressed in the `InputEvent`.

`readable_key(key: InputEventKey)`

Translates a raw InputEventKey into a human-readable string representation. This is useful for displaying what key was pressed, including modifiers like "ctrl" or "shift" and physical key names.

```bash
## Basic example
func _input(event: InputEvent):
	if event is InputEventKey:
	   InputHelper.readable_key(event)
		# Display the pressed key combination (e.g., "ctrl + alt + shift")
   	   print("Pressed key:", readable_key_text)
```

`is_controller_button(event: InputEvent) -> bool`

Quickly checks if the event is a controller button _(joypad button)_

`is_controller_axis(event: InputEvent) -> bool`

Quickly checks if the event is a controller motion _(joypad motion)_

`is_gamepad_input(event: InputEvent) -> bool`

Check if the current input comes from gamepad. It's a combination of **is_controller_button** and **is_controller_axis**

`release_input_actions(actions: Array[StringName] = [])`

Releases held input actions. This is useful for situations where you want to interrupt a continuously held input, such as canceling a cinematic trigger, ending a time stop effect, or breaking a player stun.

`is_any_action_just_pressed(actions: Array, event: InputEvent = null):`

This powerful function checks if any of the actions listed in the provided actions array were just pressed in the InputEvent. This can simplify handling multiple key or button presses simultaneously.

`action_just_pressed_and_exists(action: String) -> bool:`

This function checks if the action exists in the `InputMap` and is just pressed. The static class `Input` is used directly so this function only needs the input action name.

`action_pressed_and_exists(action: String, event: InputEvent = null) -> bool:`

This function checks if the action exists in the `InputMap` and is pressed. This one can receiev an `InputEvent` as it's being used the `event.is_action_pressed`

`is_any_action_pressed(actions: Array, event:InputEvent = null):`

Similar to `is_any_action_just_pressed`, but checks if any of the actions in the array are currently being held down (pressed).

`is_any_action_just_released actions: Array, event: InputEvent = null):`

This function checks if any of the actions in the actions array were just released in the InputEvent. This can be useful for detecting when a player lets go of a key or button.

`is_any_action_released(actions: Array, event: InputEvent)`

This function checks if any of the actions in the actions array were released in the InputEvent. This can be useful for detecting when a player lets go of a key or button.

`get_all_inputs_for_action(action: String) -> Array[InputEvent]`

Get all input events defined in the `InputMap` for the given action name, returns an empty array if the action does not exist.

`get_keyboard_inputs_for_action(action: String) -> Array[InputEvent]`

Get all keyboard input events defined in the `InputMap` for the given action name, returns an empty array if the action does not exist.

`get_keyboard_input_for_action(action: String) -> InputEvent`

Get the first keyboard input for the given action that exists in the `InputMap`

`get_joypad_inputs_for_action(action: String) -> Array[InputEvent]`

Get all joypad input events defined in the `InputMap` for the given action name, returns an empty array if the action does not exist.

`get_joypad_input_for_action(action: String) -> InputEvent`

Get the first joypad input for the given action that exists in the `InputMap`

### TransformedInput

This class simplifies handling and transforming player input directions in your Godot games. It provides various properties and functions to access and manipulate input based on your needs.

- **Deadzone Support:** Implements a deadzone to eliminate minor joystick movements or imprecise keyboard inputs around the center _(zero value)_. You can customize the deadzone size using the deadzone property _(default: 0.5)_.
- **2D and 3D Compatibility:** Works seamlessly with both 2D _(Node2D) and 3D (Node3D)_ actors, allowing you to retrieve input directions in either scene type.
- **Multiple Input Representations:** Offers access to input directions in various formats:
  - **Input direction:** Provides a 2D vector representing the raw input direction.
  - **Input joy direction left/right:** Provides a 2D vector representing the input direction from a gamepad joy.
  - **Deadzone-applied Direction:** Returns a 2D vector with the deadzone applied, resulting in a more refined input direction.
  - **Separate Horizontal and Vertical Axes:** Exposes individual values for horizontal and vertical input axes.
  - **Deadzone-applied Horizontal/Vertical Axes:** Provides separate horizontal and vertical axes with the deadzone applied.
  - **World Coordinate Space Direction (3D Only):** In 3D scenes, calculates the input direction in the actor's world coordinate space for movement calculations.

A new `TransformedInputn` can receive this parameters on the constructor:

- `actor (Node)`: A reference to the actor _(either Node2D or Node3D)_ from which the input is retrieved.
- `deadzone (float)`: Controls the deadzone size _(range: 0.0 to 1.0)_. Higher values create a larger deadzone.

The only function you need to use from this class is `update()` that **save the current direction into previous variables** and **update the directions** from the current inputs.

By default it uses this inputs action names that comes preconfigured on this template, if you want to use other names just change the variables or use the set methods `change_move_[DIRECTION]_action(new_action: String)` in the class:

```csharp
class_name TransformedInput

var move_right_action: String = "move_right"
var move_left_action: String = "move_left"
var move_forward_action: String = "move_forward"
var move_back_action: String = "move_back"

var actor: Node
var deadzone: float = 0.5:
	set(value):
		deadzone = clamp(value, 0.0, 1.0)

var input_direction: Vector2
var input_direction_deadzone_square_shape: Vector2
var input_direction_horizontal_axis: float
var input_direction_vertical_axis: float
var input_direction_horizontal_axis_applied_deadzone: float
var input_direction_vertical_axis_applied_deadzone: float
var input_joy_direction_left: Vector2
var input_joy_direction_right: Vector2
var world_coordinate_space_direction: Vector3

var previous_input_direction: Vector2
var previous_input_direction_deadzone_square_shape: Vector2
var previous_input_direction_horizontal_axis: float
var previous_input_direction_vertical_axis: float
var previous_input_direction_horizontal_axis_applied_deadzone: float
var previous_input_direction_vertical_axis_applied_deadzone: float
var previous_input_joy_direction_left: Vector2
var previous_input_joy_direction_right: Vector2
var previous_world_coordinate_space_direction: Vector3

//...

```

#### Example of use

```csharp
class_name FirstPersonController extends CharacterBody3D

var motion_input = TransformedInput.new(self)

## //...

func _physics_process(delta):
	motion_input.update() // This is the method that updates the direction each frame

	if swing_head and is_on_ground:
		swing_head_effect.apply(motion_input.input_direction)

	if motion_input.world_coordinate_space_direction.is_zero_approx():
		velocity = velocity.lerp(Vector3.ZERO, 0.8)
		## //...

```
